# Welcome

Welcome to the TheAlternative Hacking Session. This session is designed as an exercise session to go with the Toolkit course. If you did not attend the toolkit course you might want to first have a look at the slides of that course, we will explain you a bit further down where to find them. Please read this page carefully.  

## A word about organistaion

### Exclusion of liability

By doing this exercise you are aware that you alone are responsible for your computer and data. TheAlternative and its mother organisation (Student Sustainability Comission) are not liable for any damage or loose of data.

### Ask

If anything is unclear in the exercises feel free to raise your hand and a helper will come to you. (*Hint:* this might not work if you are doing the exercise at home.)

### Google

The exercises are designed in a way that you have to find stuff out by yourself. There are various ways you can go about that. Reading the manual `man` command is one way, doing a quick web search online another.

### Difficulty

The exercises are not meant to be all solved within 2 hours by a complete beginner. There are exercises with varying degrees of difficulty. Do not worry if something is too difficult for you at the moment or if you spend a lot of time on something. Feel free to skip some exercises.

On the other hand, if you are already somewhat experienced with the command line please feel free to skip the exercises you already know.


## Getting what you need

Next to this exercise sheet there are further files you will need for various exercises. Those files can be found on the TheAlternative GitHub repository. Do not worry if you do not know yet what git is and how to use it. Simply follow the steps described below:

* open the terminal on your computer
* *optional: navigate to the directory you wish to clone the git repo to*
