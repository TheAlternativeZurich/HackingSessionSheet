# Welcome
Welcome to the Hacking Session! This workshop is designed as an exercise to go with the Toolkit course. If you did not attend said course, we suggest you have a look at its slides, which can be found on our website. However, you can of course also solve them independently. 
Please make sure to read this page carefully before starting.

## A Word About Organisation

__Exclusion of liability__

By taking part in this exercise, you acknowledge that you alone are responsible for your computer. 
TheAlternative and its parent organisation, the Student Sustainability Commission, will not be held liable for any damages or loss of data.

__Ask__

If anything is unclear in the exercises feel free to raise your hand and one of our staff members will come and help you. 

__Difficulty__

The exercises are designed to be solved through self-initiative. For most exercises there are no step-by-step guides, but we will give you hints that point you in the right direction. In addition, the usage of manual pages and search engines is actively encouraged.  The exercises are generally not meant to be completely solved within the 2 hours given to you in the session, as we tried to present a wide range of different topics with varying degrees of difficulty. Feel free to skip some exercises if they're not challenging or interesting enough to you, or if you get stuck at something.

## Getting What You Need
In addition to this exercise sheet, you will need to download some files for some of the exercises. Those files can be found on our Github repository. Do not worry if you do not know yet what `git` is and how to use it. Simply follow the steps described below:

* Open the terminal on your computer
* Navigate to the directory you wish to download the files to
* Type `git clone https://github.com/TheAlternativeZurich/HackingSession.git`

Now you have all the necessary files and directories and you are ready to start.

Have fun!
