## Jobs

### Exercise 1 (fg, bg, &, top, htop, kill, pkill, killall)

* install htop if you do not already have it
* Navigate to the jobs directory
* run the $infiniteloopscript 
* Now your terminal is pretty unusable
* you can kill this by pressing Ctrl+C

Now we want to learn how to kill processes running in the background. This is helpful when you have programs that have hung themselves up and you want to kill. This is similar to the taskmanager under Windows. So we will now basically learn how to make Ctrl+Alt+Delete under Linux ;)

* run the script again in a way that it becomes a background job
* make it to be a foreground job, is that any different from a background job?
* now move it back to be a background job. Can you still kill it with Ctrl+C?
* try and find out the pid of your started process (you might want to do this in a different terminal)
* use the kill command to get ride of the process

### Exercise 2  (ps, kill, killall, pkill)

Do the same as above but this time without using top or htop and use a different method to kill it. You also do not need to do all that background foreground stuff again.

Can you find the parent of the process you started?

### Exercise 3 (dunno something fun here, at)
