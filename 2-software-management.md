## Software management

This exercise is about installing and managing software.

### Package manager

a) Refresh the sources of your package manager
b) Install updates for your system
c) If you are under Ubuntu, remove old software by using `autoremove` (otherwise skip this step)
d) Search for a package called  `youtube-dl`
e) Install the package you found in the previous step
f) Run `youtube-dl` to see if it works. It should display something like "Usage: ..."
g) Open the man page for `youtube-dl`
h) Remove `youtube-dl` from your system
i) Look at the disk usage of your system partition (hint: `df`). Then clean the cache of your package manager. Look at the disk usage again: some space should have been freed.
