## Basics
This aims to train usage in basic commands.




## man
man is the command that you will need all along this hacking session. It stands for 'manual' and displays the manual of a command, i. e. what the command does/can do, which options are possible or not, what input and output are etc. The output of man is also called a manpage.
Almost all commands (all that we will deal with today) have manpages that are provided together with the program
exercise: If you don't want the default manpage for a program, how can you tell man to use another file?
answer: man -C file (just lookup the manpage of man)

## flags
flags are options you can add to a command: for example, if you want to list all files including hidden files, you will use the corresponding flag (that you will find in the manual of the program).

## ls
ls stands for 'list'.
How can you list only hidden files

## mv

## cd

## rm

## sudo

## mkdir

## cp
