#CHAPTER 0: Basics
##Info part
-> Desperately needs a rewrite
-> The sections `Flags` in Chapter 0 uses `ls` as an example before the reader even knows what the command does.
-> `Flags` sections references the terms `bash` and `recursive` with no explanation whatsoever.
-> Wildcards section is missing the question mark wildcard and the bracket wildcard.
-> sudo section references the `sudo group` but doesn't elaborate on it
