-> Welcome text explaining what this is about and how to work. Document will be online.
-> Completely remove tee from the solutions
-> Search ex. 2 and 3 have no solutions
-> Files ex. n) exercise and solution don't match
-> Remote ex. 1 e) and f) solutions: We cannot assume that all people have done the other exercise too; fill in a correct solution here as well
-> Some section (e.g. jobs) just start, without giving a description of what will be learned here. Users should be able to decide from the first paragraph if they want to do a particular exercise.
-> Searching ex. 1 is not understandable for a normal person, especially the part with the regex
-> The commands introduced in the first part come with absolutely no explanation whatsoever. For chmod, this is way too hard and must be explained better.
-> Files exercise j): Distinguish hard- and softlinks? For softlinks, pitfall: absolute paths must be used
